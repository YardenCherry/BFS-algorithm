<h1> BFS algorithm </h1>
Bidirectional BFS implementation (Bidirectional Search) in which two BFSs are activated, one from the starting point and the other from the destination point. The algorithm (Bidirectional Search) ends when the two searches meet. At the end of the algorithm, the resulting route is shown, which is also the shortest route from the starting point to the destination point.
